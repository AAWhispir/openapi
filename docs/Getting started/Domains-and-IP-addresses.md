# Domains-and-IP-addresses

If your implementation depends on IP Whitelisting in order to make calls to our service, we suggest that you review the following set of [Amazon IPs](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json). You will need to whitelist all IP ranges.

```AU/NZ
some ips
```
```SEA
some ips
```
```NA
some ips
```
