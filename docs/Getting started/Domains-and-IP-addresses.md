# Domains-and-IP-addresses

If your implementation depends on IP Whitelisting in order to make calls to our service, we suggest that you review the following set of [Amazon IPs](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json). You will need to whitelist all IP ranges.

```AU/NZ
AU - https://api.au.whispir.com
NZ - https://api.nz.whispir.com
```
```ASIA
AP - https://api.ap.whispir.com
AP1 - https://api.ap1.whispir.com
```
```NA
US - https://api.us.whispir.com
```
```OTHER
IT - https://api.it.whispir.com
EDU - https://api.education.whispir.com
```

## How can I identify my region?
Do one of the following:

- Log in to your Whispir account. The region is usually shown in you Whispir platform URL, where the format is https://<region>.whispir.com.
- Ask your company administrator.
- If you're still unsure contact the Whispir Support Team and provide your API key. The Support Team can tell you your region-specific API URL.
