# About the Whispir platform API

Built by developers, for developers, Whispir is the place where you can easily build communications into your app – SMS, email, push, voice, chat, web, social networks and web pages.

Whispir APIs let developers:

- Create, send and retrieve multi-channel messages over 8 different channels.
- Invoke scenario-based communications for quick, effective and targeted communications.
- Publish messages to internal or external web pages, RSS feeds and social networks.
- Asynchronously receive all responses to a given message and perform analysis on the data.

# Templates API

The Whispir Templates API lets developers:

- Create rich, cross-channel message templates that can be managed by designers within the Whispir Rich Message Studio.
- Ensure a DRY (‘don’t repeat yourself’) pattern within developer code by separating the communication content from code.
- Reduce code change by managing content elsewhere.

# Events Management API

The Events Management API provides developers with the tools needed to manage the communications around events:

- Save different event details, such as Severity, Priority, Description and Tasks, to ensure a path to a seamless resolution.
- Automatically inform teams through Whispir’s integrated cross-channel messaging, ensuring that you know who has received a message and, more importantly, who hasn’t.

# Contacts Management API

The Contacts Management API provides developers with the ability to manage the recipients of their messages:

- Store contact information in a cloud-based, highly available and accessible environment.
- Use standards based methods to create, update, and delete contact information.
- Build forms to allow contacts to self-register and manage their account, with auto-generated email notifications.
- Create, update and delete distribution lists that can be accessed for messaging at a later date.
