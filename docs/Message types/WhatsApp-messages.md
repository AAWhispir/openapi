# WhatsApp messages

## Overview

Customers can send templated WhatsApp messages via Whispir's API. 

Templates must first be submitted for approval by WhatsApp in your WhatsApp Business Manager account before any template messages can be sent from Whispir. Please reach out to your Whispir account manager to help you get started.
